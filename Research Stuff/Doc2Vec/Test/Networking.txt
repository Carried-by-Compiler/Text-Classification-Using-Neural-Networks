What is Networking
Networking is a process that fosters the exchange of information and ideas among individuals or groups that share a common interest. It may be for social or business purposes. Professionals connect their business network through a series of symbolic ties and contacts. Business connections may form due to an individual's education, employer, industry or colleagues. For instance, a business network of Harvard Business School alumni may develop. Networking may also refer to the setting up and operation of a physical computer network.
