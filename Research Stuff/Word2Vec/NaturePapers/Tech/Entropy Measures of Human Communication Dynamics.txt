For many decades, existing memory technologies have been successfully scaled down
and improved to achieve higher densities, faster speeds with lower production costs.
Now, however, the miniaturization level of these technologies is approaching the physical
limits for scalability. This raises the importance of urgent development of new
memory technologies. One of the most promising candidates is spin-transfer torque
magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) [Chen et al. 2010], which combines the
capacity and cost benefits of DRAM, fast performance of SRAM, virtually unlimited
endurance in addition to being nonvolatile and radiation hard. Conventional semiconductor
memory technology typically involves the charge of electrons and completely
