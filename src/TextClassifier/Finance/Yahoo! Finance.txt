== Development history ==
In the introduction to a 2009 interview with Forbes.com, former general manager Nathan Richardson was said to have built "annual revenue from $10 million to $110 million and expanded the site's content partners from 10 to 200. In 2005 Institutional Investor ranked [Richardson] the most influential person in online finance." In the interview, Richardson described the process of building the financial-information modules and creating a "moat" around the content (to keep visitors sticking to the site).


== Recognition ==
In January 2014, Yahoo! Finance was named the No. 1 site "favored by Republicans 18 or older with annual household incomes of $100,000 or more" by conservative media organization Newsmax, based on viewership numbers tracked using the comScore Plan Metrix research service.
